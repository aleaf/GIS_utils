## To install the python GIS tool chain

1) install the [Anaconda Python Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

2) at the command line:

```
$ python install_packages.py gis.yml
```

Note that when python is called at the command line, the Anaconda version should come up (indicated by the text above the `>>>` after running `$ python `)
